    <p class="nice-p">Stinaâ€™s center is in the Caribbean and she is regularly looking for working students and interns,
        who want to
        spend
        at least two months or more
        at <?= Html::a('Richmond Vale Nature, Diving and Hiking Center', 'http://www.richmondvalehiking.com') ?>
        taking care of the small herd of 5 former wild horses.

        The life at the center is has a variety of tasks like grooming, fixing fences, trimming, training horses and
        picking
        up manure for the organic garden. As our center is sited very remote you can experience a sort of freedom up
        here
        that is difficult to find in more colonized areas.

        <?= Html::a('Read more', 'http://stinaherberg.com/internship/') ?> about the possibilities and expectations of
        becoming a working student at SVG Horse School.
